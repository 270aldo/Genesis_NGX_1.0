# OpenTelemetry Import Fix Report

**Date**: 2025-07-29
**Issue**: ImportError: cannot import name '_set_status' from 'opentelemetry.instrumentation._semconv'
**Status**: RESOLVED ✅

## Problem Summary
The orchestrator failed to load due to an import error in the OpenTelemetry instrumentation packages. This was blocking the Beta Validation tests and preventing system startup.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Version Mismatch**
- requirements.txt had OpenTelemetry API/SDK at version 1.33.1
- pyproject.toml specified version 1.27.0
- Instrumentation packages were at version 0.48b0 (beta)
- The versions were incompatible due to breaking API changes

### 2. **Missing Dependencies**
- OpenTelemetry instrumentation packages were defined in an optional `telemetry` group
- These packages were not being exported to requirements.txt
- When core/telemetry.py tried to import instrumentation classes, they were not available

### 3. **API Breaking Changes**
- The `_set_status` function was moved/renamed between versions
- This caused internal import failures in the instrumentation packages

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Moved Telemetry Dependencies to Main Section**
Moved all OpenTelemetry packages from the optional telemetry group to the main dependencies in pyproject.toml:
```toml
opentelemetry-api = "1.27.0"
opentelemetry-sdk = "1.27.0"
opentelemetry-instrumentation = "0.48b0"
opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi = "0.48b0"
opentelemetry-instrumentation-httpx = "0.48b0"
opentelemetry-instrumentation-logging = "0.48b0"
opentelemetry-instrumentation-aiohttp-client = "0.48b0"
opentelemetry-semantic-conventions = "0.48b0"
opentelemetry-exporter-gcp-trace = "^1.9.0"
google-cloud-trace = "^1.16.1"
```

### 2. **Synchronized Dependencies**
- Updated poetry.lock with `poetry lock`
- Regenerated requirements.txt with sync script
- Installed updated dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 3. **Verified Fix**
- All OpenTelemetry imports now work correctly
- Telemetry initialization succeeds
- No more `_set_status` import errors

## Files Modified
1. `/backend/pyproject.toml` - Moved telemetry dependencies to main section
2. `/backend/poetry.lock` - Updated via poetry lock
3. `/backend/requirements.txt` - Regenerated with all telemetry packages included

## Verification Tests
```python
# All imports now work:
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.fastapi import FastAPIInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.httpx import HTTPXClientInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.logging import LoggingInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.aiohttp_client import AioHttpClientInstrumentor

# Telemetry initialization succeeds:
from core.telemetry import initialize_telemetry
initialize_telemetry()  # No errors
```

## Remaining Warnings
1. **pkg_resources deprecation warning** - This is from OpenTelemetry itself and will be fixed in future versions
2. **ADK Toolkit import issue** - Separate issue unrelated to OpenTelemetry

## Recommendations
1. Keep all required dependencies in the main section of pyproject.toml
2. Consider upgrading to stable versions of OpenTelemetry instrumentation when available
3. Monitor for pkg_resources deprecation fixes in future OpenTelemetry releases
4. Add tests to verify all critical imports during CI/CD

## Impact
- ✅ Orchestrator can now load successfully
- ✅ Beta Validation tests can proceed
- ✅ All telemetry instrumentation is available
- ✅ System can start without import errors
